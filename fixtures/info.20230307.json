      "content": "This guide is not part of any puzzle.\r\nIt’s just laying out some instructions for the hunt.\r\n\r\n## Rules and format\r\n\r\n1. \tEach puzzle has an answer which consists of English letters.\r\n\tThe answers are not case sensitive and spaces are disregarded,\r\n\tbut the spelling must match exactly.\r\n2. Each time you submit an answer, the answer checker will verify it.\r\n\t- This can take anywhere from 10 to 60 seconds depending on\r\n\t\thow fast your computer is.\r\n\t- If your answer is correct, you will be given a link to a new page.\r\n\t- Beyond having to wait a while to get an answer checked off,\r\n\t\tthere is no penalty or limit on checking answers.\r\n\t- Moreover, the answer checker provides extra nudges\r\n\t\tfor certain cluephrases that are close to the answer.\r\n\t- Therefore, you are encouraged to call in guesses as much as you want.\r\n3. The following ARE allowed.\r\n\t- Guessing as many things into the answer checker as you want.\r\n\t- Guessing at URL’s except for those under web.evanchen.cc.\r\n\t- Searching the Internet freely for resources.\r\n\t- Writing programs to help you work on a puzzle, as long as they are local.\r\n4. The following are NOT allowed.\r\n\t- You should not spoil the hunt outside the MOSP Discord.\r\n\t- You will NOT need to guess any URL’s on the site web.evanchen.cc.\r\n\t\tYou can try a few if you really want, but don’t bulk-guess for my server’s sake.\r\n\t- Do NOT make any form of repeated or automated requests to a server\r\n\t\tsuch as this site, Discord, Gradescope, Google Classroom, Zoom, etc.\r\n\t\t(For example, you should NOT write a script to randomly guess URL’s or answers.)\r\n\t- Don't try to hack the website.\r\n\t- **None of the puzzles require you to inspect the source code of pages.**\r\n\t\tYou can look if you want, but we think it’s more misleading than helpful.\r\n\r\n## Courage and Patience\r\n\r\nThis hunt is quite difficult (not quite Mystery Hunt level but getting there),\r\nand we want you to have fun, so you should feel welcome to get hints\r\nwhenever you aren't having fun.\r\n\r\nPing `@admin` for hints too.\r\n\r\n## Teams\r\n\r\nThere is no limit on team size but\r\nwe think that most people will have the most fun\r\nworking on the hunt **in teams of 3-5 people**.\r\n(Which conveniently is equal to the number of people\r\nin your social group if you signed up for one.)",
