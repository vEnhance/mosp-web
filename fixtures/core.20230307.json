It'll be a while.\"\r\n\r\nThere's a bit of silence as the meaning of what Steve says slowly sinks in.\r\n\r\n![His name's Steve I guess.](/static/2021/meeting-sm.png)\r\n\r\nSteve, on the other hand, seems totally non-serious.\r\n\"Heya, don't look so shell-shocked.

It's a lot like what you call MOP on your side.\"\r\nSteve thinks for a bit, and then suddenly adds,\r\n\"Oh hey, we got an opening for assistant director of MOSP. Ya want in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I... what?\" You're not sure what to say. \"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, I'm the academic director,\" Steve explains,\r\n\"but we also need an assistant director to help put out random metaphorical fires.\r\nYou look pretty good at figuring things out. I'm sure you're up to it.\r\nNot much else to do 'round these parts anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's the director then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't have one, who needs those?\" Steve shrugs.\r\n\r\n\"Uh, then why is it called assistant director?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, 'cause you direct the assistants. Obviously.\"\r\n\r\n\"‚Ä¶ And how many assistants do I have?\"\r\n\r\nSteve shrugs again, maintaining his incessant grin.\r\n\"Beats me. Well, actually, probably zero, to be honest.\"\r\n\r\nSteve searches the bookshelf for a moment,\r\nthen finds a folder and hands it to you.\r\nIt appears to be some sort of map.\r\n\"Hey, pal, don't try to make too much sense out of everything.\r\nYa can't live life that way.\r\nJust laugh when you don't understand, and play along!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that, as if today hadn't been strange enough already,\r\nSteve simply vanishes into thin air,\r\nleaving you alone with only Steve's map to guide you.",

Except you.\r\nYou glance up at the clock analog on the wall, which usually ticks a staccato beat. It‚Äôs 2:30 PM‚Äî and somehow, the clock is dead silent. The second hand has lost its constant motion‚Äî whatever happened, the clock‚Äôs suddenly been broken.\r\nNo‚Äî it suddenly hits you‚Äî the clock‚Äôs been stopped. Just like the students.\r\nJust, it seems, like time itself.\r\n\r\nA literally unmeasurable amount of time later, you‚Äôve confirmed the following through some simple science:\r\nYou can still open doors, pick up pencils, trip over carpets (embarrassingly often). You sure aren‚Äôt getting signal, though, and without ready access to a charger (locked yourself out this morning!) you‚Äôd better use your phone sparingly ‚Äì thankfully, it still turns on.\r\nThe sun is still shining, and lights are still running. You don‚Äôt even want to consider the implications of that on the Earth‚Äôs orbit, or on CMU‚Äôs electricity bill. But no wind blows, no clouds move, and despite your patience the sun resolutely hovers in its stalwart position. \r\nMoreover, all animal life has come to a screeching halt‚Äî people aside, you‚Äôve seen mosquitoes frozen midair as if preserved in amber (and killed one of those nuisances for good measure). You can wiggle your classmates‚Äô arms, but you sure can‚Äôt make them talk (and so you‚Äôve decided to leave them be for now).\r\nIn short, the world is yours for the taking.\r\n\r\nSeveral petty thefts later, you gradually become aware of a quiet buzzing sensation in your skeleton. It‚Äôs not wholly unpleasant, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt there before‚Äî and as you traipse across Tepper Quad in search for another, ah, involuntary borrower, it gradually becomes stronger. So after you add a few more sawbucks to your purse, you decide to check it out‚Äî sorta like a hot and cold game, you suppose, moving in the same general direction. The buzz leads you to the west, into a building, down two flights of stairs, through a hidden passage behind a bookshelf (since when was that there?), and smack dab into the Physics Department.\r\nAs you step into the latter, though, the buzzing in your bones spikes almost painfully, like a static shock, before subsiding almost altogether‚Äî what‚Äôs left isn‚Äôt much of a hum so much as a resonance. You feel in tune with whatever led you here. With the‚Ä¶\r\n‚Ä¶the‚Ä¶\r\n‚Ä¶the gigantic‚Ä¶ twenty-terawatt‚Ä¶ standard-issue Carnegie Mellon University synchrotron???\r\n\r\nOnce you recover from that shock, you take a closer look around the room. All the researchers, who seem to have their eyes on the synchrotron, frozen in expressions that look vaguely surprised (as if they had been interrupted before managing to make the full expression). The great beast itself is‚Ä¶ chugging along quietly and clearly doing some kind of work, though the only conspicuous way to interface with it seems to be some kind of control panel locked with a physical key.\r\nOne faster-than-light mugging (relatively speaking) later, you stare down a keyboard and terminal prompting you to `>ENTER PASSWORD`. Seems old Synchy here doesn‚Äôt like you that much.\r\nNo matter! You simply cast about for a sticky note on the lab tables. Researchers love to leave passwords lying out willy-nilly on Post-its and other such easily accessible lab features, despite the perpetual tortured screams of the IT departments.\r\nWhat you find, instead, is a legal pad labeled ‚ÄúIN CASE OF PASSWORD FORGOTTEN: Find and solve weird puzzles around campus,‚Äù attached to a hand-drawn map with X‚Äôs drawn everywhere.\r\nLovely.\r\nAs you pick up the pad and turn to leave, a glint catches your eye. You turn and catch a glimpse of an iridescent spark, shining over the head of one of the researchers‚Äî she seems to be an older lady, gray-haired, clearly in charge here. On instinct, you reach out and touch it‚Äî\r\n‚Äîand the world lurches sideways for a moment‚Äî\r\nYou can hardly contain your excitement, though it barely shows on your face. Holy heck this is going to get us so much grant money, you do not say out loud, though you are thinking it clear as day.\r\n‚ÄúHeckuva lucky find, Jack brought in,‚Äù you say instead. ‚ÄúSaved us a whole dang decade of research. Guess those interns‚Äôre useful for something after all.‚Äù\r\nYour assistant does not cackle, because you are respectable faculty of the science department and not witches. Instead she says, ‚ÄúSynchrotron‚Äôs already all loaded up. Formula scanned in and everything. Got Alice to double-check the input, too.‚Äù\r\n‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù you declare. ‚ÄúHit the switch!‚Äù\r\nThere‚Äôs a whine as the synchrotron powers on‚Äî\r\n‚Äîand a sudden spike of buzz in your bones‚Äî\r\n‚Äîand then the world lurches‚Äî\r\nand you‚Äôre back in your body again, staring a sixty-odd year old physicist in the eye.\r\n\r\nThis is what you know:\r\nYou are an attendee at the prestigious summer program MOP to learn competition math;\r\nSomehow, you‚Äôve been dragged into fixing these weirdo scientists‚Äô time anomaly;\r\nYou have never seen such a mess before;\r\nand this is the most excited you‚Äôve been in your whole life.",

      "solution_text": "This solution describes the version of the puzzle given at MOP.\r\nSee the author notes for the public version given after MOP.\r\n\r\nThis kick-off puzzle is started by looking at the test passwords.\r\n\r\n## Hints about the passwords\r\n\r\nThere were a few hints that the passwords to this year's\r\nMOP tests were not random:\r\n\r\n* The unusual structure of the passwords (hashtag in 7th character always).\r\n* Returning students might also have remembered a hidden message\r\n  being contained in the passwords the previous year.\r\n* During [Assembly Meeting 1](/static/2021/onlinemop/assembly-hint.png), sections on the left\r\n  had first letters spelling out `TEST PASSWORD`.\r\n* The world map had the password to Sample 0 spelled out in emojis.\r\n\t![123689ACDE#0](/static/2021/onlinemop/sample-breadcrumb.png)\r\n\r\n## The message in the passwords\r\n\r\nThe passwords to the MOP 2021 tests, in the order they appear, are:\r\n\r\n| Test        | Password        |\r\n|-------------|-----------------|\r\n| Sample0     | `123689ACDE#0`  |\r\n| Quiz1       | `_MDITF#6`      |\r\n| Test2       | `_YFHML#D`      |\r\n| Test3       | `EL_E_R#C`      |\r\n| Test4       | `ERT_IW#9`      |\r\n| Quiz5       | `HE_TH_#8`      |\r\n| MockIMODay1 | `IONNNP#1`      |\r\n| MockIMODay2 | `REOBSO#A`      |\r\n| Quiz6       | `S_E__O#3`      |\r\n| Test7       | `TUEDD_#2`      |\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Sample0 edge case,\r\nthese passwords are in alphabetical order.\r\nSo the first step is to reorder the passwords by the last digit,\r\nwhich turns out to correspond to the string in Sample0.\r\n\r\n| Test        | Password        |\r\n|-------------|-----------------|\r\n| MockIMODay1 | `IONNNP#1`      |\r\n| Test7       | `TUEDD_#2`      |\r\n| Quiz6       | `S_E__O#3`      |\r\n| Quiz1       | `_MDITF#6`      |\r\n| Quiz5       | `HE_TH_#8`      |\r\n| Test4       | `ERT_IW#9`      |\r\n| MockIMODay2 | `REOBSO#A`      |\r\n| Test3       | `EL_E_R#C`      |\r\n| Test2       | `_YFHML#D`      |\r\n\r\nReading the passwords, one finds what is evidently a message\r\n(with underscores denoting spaces),\r\nalthough it seems like the last row of the table is missing.\r\nThis is confirmed by the Sample0 password having an `E` in it,\r\nwhich is apparently not here.\r\nFilling in the last row to complete words gives the following:\r\n\r\n| Test        | Password        |\r\n|-------------|-----------------|\r\n| MockIMODay1 | `IONNNP#1`      |\r\n| Test7       | `TUEDD_#2`      |\r\n| Quiz6       | `S_E__O#3`      |\r\n| Quiz1       | `_MDITF#6`      |\r\n| Quiz5       | `HE_TH_#8`      |\r\n| Test4       | `ERT_IW#9`      |\r\n| MockIMODay2 | `REOBSO#A`      |\r\n| Test3       | `EL_E_R#C`      |\r\n| Test2       | `_YFHML#D`      |\r\n| ?           | `Y_IIAD#E`      |\r\n\r\nReading down the columns (like MOP 2020),\r\nthis spells the message\r\n`IT'S HERE YOU MERELY NEED TO FIND IT BEHIND THIS MAP OF WORLD`.\r\n\r\nThis clues looking at the MOP 2021 world map\r\nand seeing what is going on there.\r\n(Really observant MOP students might have noticed that, behind the world map,\r\none would see the word \"Loading...\" while the main image started up.)\r\nIf one makes a copy of the document and moves the items aside,\r\none finds a large downwards arrow.\r\nOpening the arrow leads to the MOSP website and starts the hunt.\r\n\r\n## Finding the hidden tests\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the MOSP website for the first time,\r\nsolvers are greeted with the answer checker to K\r\nand are prompted with the following message:\r\n\r\n> * To solve K, you need to find Test 8, Quiz 8, and Mock IMO Day 3.\r\n> * Each of these is a brand-new PDF you'll need to find the link to.\r\n> * You do NOT need to guess URL's under web.evanchen.cc.\r\n> \tYou may need to guess URL's in other places.\r\n\r\nSo, the solvers start to look for these exams in other places.\r\nIf the solver thinks back to where the arrow in the map was pointing,\r\nit was pointing towards the TinyURL at the bottom of the page.\r\n(This was hinted on the scavenger hunt spreadsheet as well,\r\nwith the hidden message `hi~ congrats on finding this message\r\nwhen you find the arrow look where it's pointing` in cells\r\nthat looked like they were blank.)\r\nTogether with the suspicious 8's at the end of the URL,\r\nsolvers need to guess three tinyURL's for Test 8, Quiz 8, and Mock IMO Day 3.\r\n\r\nThis gives the solver three new files containing problems from past MOP tests.\r\nThey are password protected, but the password is known from earlier step.\r\n\r\n## Colors\r\n\r\nEach of the secret tests had 24 problems in it.\r\nTaking the Red test as an example,\r\none sees that the odd-numbered problems were all P1 on some Red test,\r\nwhile the even-numbered problems were all P2 on some Red test.\r\nThis naturally suggests pairing the problems into 12 pairs.\r\n\r\nFor each pair, the solver writes down the test it came from\r\nand the hexadecimal digit at the end of the corresponding password.\r\nIn this way, one obtains 12 hexadecimal color codes.\r\n(The step of looking at hexadecimal colors was\r\nalso clued in [tests on Gradescope](/static/2021/onlinemop/gradescope-hint.png),\r\nin which the due times spelled out `HEX COLORS` via A1Z26 on the\r\nirregular minute times.)\r\n\r\nEach of the colors has a\r\n[canonical name](https://www.colorhexa.com/color-names);\r\nthese are also the top results\r\nobtained when searching the specific hex code.\r\n\r\n\\# | Color                  | Red | Green | Blue\r\n---|------------------------|:---:|:-----:|:----:\r\n 1 | Urobilin               | E1  |  AD   |  21\r\n 2 | Smoky black            | 10  |  0C   |  08\r\n 3 | Amethyst               | 99  |  66   |  CC\r\n 4 | Cocoa brown            | D2  |  69   |  1E\r\n 5 | Harvard crimson        | C9  |  00   |  16\r\n 6 | Ruddy pink             | E1  |  8E   |  96\r\n 7 | Old rose               | C0  |  80   |  81\r\n 8 | Medium candy apple red | E2  |  06   |  2C\r\n 9 | Amethyst               | 99  |  66   |  CC\r\n10 | KU Crimson             | E8  |  00   |  0D\r\n11 | Eton blue              | 96  |  C8   |  A2\r\n12 | Yellow green           | 9A  |  CD   |  32\r\n\r\n(The fourth color is also called Cinnamon or Chocolate in some places.)\r\nReading the first letters of the colors spells\r\n`USA CHROMA KEY`{.answer}, the answer.",
      "author_notes": "The K puzzle was written before any intention of creating a proper hunt.\r\nOriginally, I figured that people would be expecting something\r\nin the test passwords,\r\nand I set a single puzzle K with some shortlist problems as a reward.\r\n\r\nBecause MOP exams are divided into color groups that happened to match\r\nthe primary colors of light,\r\nI thought it would be fitting to make a puzzle about hexadecimal color codes.\r\nThat's how we got the idea to build the puzzle around the theme\r\nof a completely black screen, which was illuminated by using light.\r\nAt the same time, I was thinking about how it would be pretty easy\r\nto \"hide\" an extra link in the world map,\r\nbecause it was sent to students as a Google Drawing,\r\nnot as a PDF or other reasonable format.\r\n\r\nThen, I thought that a one-off puzzle was too underwhelming;\r\nafter all, Evan is the most extra person‚Ñ¢.\r\nSo now there was a full round of puzzles.\r\n\r\nWe had to adapt the puzzle for the public to not incorporate\r\nMOP test materials, and thus we used the MOP 2019 tests,\r\nwhich have been mostly posted in some shape or form by now.\r\n(We themed this in terms of a MOPper at the last in-person MOP,\r\nand [adjusted the map accordingly](../../mop/).)\r\n\r\nIn the public version, in lieu of the tiny URL's,\r\nthe solvers are simply given a [problems file](puzzle.pdf)\r\nusing problems from the MOP 2019 test (which are posted).\r\nEnumerations are given for the colors to confirm them\r\n(the main ambiguity is OLIVE vs HEART GOLD),\r\ngiving the following table:\r\n\r\n\\# | Color                | Red | Green | Blue |\r\n---|----------------------|:---:|:-----:|:----:|\r\n 1 | Utah crimson         |  D3 |   00  |  3F  |\r\n 2 | School bus yellow    |  FF |   D8  |  00  |\r\n 3 | Alice blue           |  F0 |   F8  |  FF  |\r\n 4 | Candy apple red      |  FF |   08  |  00  |\r\n 5 | Honeydew             |  F0 |   FF  |  F0  |\r\n 6 | Red                  |  FF |   00  |  00  |\r\n 7 | Olive                |  80 |   80  |  00  |\r\n 8 | Maroon               |  80 |   00  |  00  |\r\n 9 | Alice blue           |  F0 |   F8  |  FF  |\r\n10 | KU Crimson           |  E8 |   00  |  0D  |\r\n11 | Electric ultramarine |  3F |   00  |  FF  |\r\n12 | Yellow               |  FF |   FF  |  00  |\r\n\r\nThis gives the answer `USA CHROMA KEY`.",

prompt:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nüî•üî•üî• EXTRA CREDIT:\r\n\r\nRe-submit with one additional global variable:\r\n\r\nreverse_engineered = \"????????????????\"\r\n\r\nThis should be a string of length seventeen such that,\r\n\r\n(1) reverse_engineered[0] = reverse_engineered[16] are the\r\nASCII character corresponding to the moderator's secret choice M.\r\n\r\n(2) For all 1 <= n <= 15, reverse_engineered[n] is the\r\nASCII character corresponding to the answer to relay question n.\r\n\r\nFor example, reverse_engineered[8] = 97 = ord('a').\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the solver is promised $0 \\le M \\le 10000$,\r\nit is pretty straightforward for the solver to ask their program\r\nto check values of $M$ and see if any of them give $97$.\r\n(Actually, there is really an implicit assumption that $0 \\le M \\le 255$,\r\nsince the values are promised to be in ASCII range.)\r\nDoing so, one finds $M = 36$.\r\nOne then finds the reverse engineered string is actually readable: it is\r\n\r\n```python\r\nreverse_engineered = \"$[0;a_1,a_2,a_3]$\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Continued fraction\r\n\r\nWhen the `reverse_engineered` string is correctly submitted, a new message\r\nappears:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nüèÅüèÅüèÅ Reverse-engineering successful!\r\nMuch partial credit awarded ;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen this happens,\r\nthe score for the user skyrockets,\r\nas does the denominators of the test cases\r\n(beforehand, the user simply got 1 point for each answer).\r\nThe solver obtains the following table:\r\n\r\n| Problem  | Numerator | Denominator |\r\n|:--------:|----------:|------------:|\r\n|   R-01   | 10477     |  702067     |\r\n|   R-02   | 3361      |  363093     |\r\n|   R-03   | 2657      |  292353     |\r\n|   R-04   | 2849      |

expansion.\r\nAs expected, each continued fraction has exactly three parts.\r\nFor example,\r\n\\\\\\[ \\frac{10477}{702067} = \\frac{1}{67+\\frac{1}{97+\\frac{1}{108}}} = [0;67,97,108]. \\\\\\]\r\nWorking out the rest of the continued fractions,\r\nwe get a sequence of numbers in ASCII range.\r\nDoing the conversion then gives the following table:\r\n\r\n| Problem  | Numerator |

      "solution_text": "The metapuzzle requires the undordered set of\r\nthe feeder answers to the previous puzzles,\r\nwhich we give below sorted first by length and then alphabetically.\r\n\r\n* `GETSUMNULL`\r\n* `KAZAKHSTAN`\r\n* `BEACONRADIUS`\r\n* `SAYNOTOCOMBO`\r\n* `USACHROMAKEY`\r\n* `FILESPECIALFORMAT`\r\n* `TEAMSELECTIONEXAM`\r\n\r\nIt's also necessary to find the puzzle itself:\r\nit's hidden in the same place that the hunt itself was,\r\nbehind the world map (this time behind the MOSP world map).\r\n\r\n## Braille\r\n\r\nThe first step is to translate the Braille grid provided.\r\nDoing so provides the following message:\r\n\r\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\r\n| N | E | W | J | O | B |\r\n| F | I | N | D |   |   |\r\n| A |   | T | E | S | T |\r\n| O | N | E | V | A | N |\r\n| C | H | E | N | C | C |\r\n| A |   | P | D | F |   |\r\n| S | O | L | N |   |   |\r\n|   |   | T | E | X | T |\r\n| U | S | A | J | M | O |\r\n| P |   | S | I | X |   |\r\n\r\nThis prompts the solver to navigate to the\r\n[problem archive at evanchen.cc](https://evanchen.cc/problems.html).\r\nOne of the tests has been conspicuously labeled \"featuring Steve\"\r\nfor no apparent reason, so the solver is prompted to open it.\r\nDoing so reminds the solver of the statement of USAJMO 2015/6:\r\n\r\n> Steve is piling $m\\geq 1$ indistinguishable stones\r\n> on the squares of an $n\\times n$ grid.\r\n> Each square can have an arbitrarily high pile of stones.\r\n> After he finished piling his stones in some manner,\r\n> he can then perform _stone moves_, defined as follows.\r\n> Consider any four grid squares, which are corners of a rectangle,\r\n> i.e. in positions $(i, k), (i, l), (j, k), (j, l)$\r\n> for some $1\\leq i, j, k, l\\leq n$, such that $i<j$ and $k<l$.\r\n> A stone move consists of either removing one stone from each of\r\n> $(i, k)$ and $(j, l)$\r\n> and moving them to $(i, l)$ and $(j, k)$ respectively,\r\n> or removing one stone from each of $(i, l)$ and $(j, k)$\r\n> and moving them to $(i, k)$ and $(j, l)$ respectively.\r\n>  \r\n> Two ways of piling the stones are equivalent\r\n> if they can be obtained from one another\r\n> by a sequence of stone moves.\r\n> How many different non-equivalent ways can\r\n> Steve pile the stones on the grid?\r\n\r\nThe solution to this problem is based on looking at the \"signature\"\r\nof a stone configuration:\r\nthe number of stones in any given row or given column.\r\nThis suggests the blue numbers given are the signature.\r\n\r\n## Crossword\r\n\r\nIt remains to complete the crossword.\r\nTo proceed further, one has to read the flavor text of the puzzle.\r\nReading it out loud, one should notice something conspicuous:\r\nas is MOSP tradition, the letter S is repeated over and over\r\n(though not quite as much as in the survey).\r\nAnd indeed, one notices that each of the answers has the letter S exactly once.\r\nSo this suggests the way to fill in the grid:\r\n\r\n* The letter S's represent the stones, and should satisfy the blue numbers.\r\n* The answers should be placed in the grid with three horizontal\r\n  and four vertical; moreover the occupied cells must be centrally symmetric.\r\n\r\nIt turns out there is a unique way to do this, depicted below.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"strong-emph\" markdown=\"1\">\r\n|     | 1 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\r\n|-----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\r\n|**0**|   |   | T |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   | E |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | G |   |\r\n|**1**| U |*S*| A | C | H | R | O | M | A | K | E | Y |\r\n|**0**|   |   | M |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | T |   |\r\n|**2**|   |   |*S*|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |*S*|   |\r\n|**0**|   |   | E |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | U |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   | L |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | M |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   | E |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | N |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   | C |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | U |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   | T |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | L |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   | I |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | L |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   | O |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   | N |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   | E |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   | X |   |   |   |   |   |   | F |   |   |\r\n|**1**| B | E | A | C | O | N | R | A | D | I | U |*S*|\r\n|**0**|   |   | M |   |   |   |   |   |   | L |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | E |   |   |\r\n|**1**|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |*S*|   |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | P |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   | K |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | E |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   | A |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | C |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   | Z |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | I |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   | A |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | A |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   | K |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | L |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   | H |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | F |   |   |\r\n|**1**|   |*S*|   |   |   |   |   |   |   | O |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   | T |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | R |   |   |\r\n|**1**|*S*| A | Y | N | O | T | O | C | O | M | B | O |\r\n|**0**|   | N |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | A |   |   |\r\n|**0**|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | T |   |   |\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Extraction\r\n\r\nThere is one step remaining: solvers need to overlay this completed\r\ngrid back onto the Braille grid (since there was otherwise no reason\r\nwhy the Braille grid should be the same dimensions as the crossword;\r\nmoreover some of the placement of empty cells in the Braille\r\nwas fairly irregular).\r\n\r\nUpon doing so, certain letters are highlighted, as shown below.\r\nThe solver then should trace out the S and read the highlighted letters,\r\nas directed by the flavor text.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"strong-emph\" markdown=\"1\">\r\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\r\n|   |   | . |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n|   |   | . |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | . |   |\r\n| . | . | A | C | H |*R*| O | M |*A*| K | E | . |\r\n|   |   | M |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | T |   |\r\n|   |   |*S*|   |   |   |   |   |   |   | S |   |\r\n|   |   | E |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | U |   |\r\n|   |   | L |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | M |   |\r\n|   |   | E |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |*N*|   |\r\n|   |   | C |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |*U*|   |\r\n|   |   |*T*|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |*L*|   |\r\n|   |   | I |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | L |   |\r\n|   |   |*O*|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n|   |   |*N*|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n|   |   |*E*|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n|   |   | X |   |   |   |   |   |   | . |   |   |\r\n| . | . | A | C |*O*|*N*|*R*|*A*|*D*|*I*| . | . |\r\n|   |   | . |   |   |   |   |   |   | L |   |   |\r\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | E |   |   |\r\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | S |   |   |\r\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | P |   |   |\r\n|   | K |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | E |   |   |\r\n|   | A |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |*C*|   |   |\r\n|   | Z |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | I |   |   |\r\n|   | A |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |*A*|   |   |\r\n|   | K |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |*L*|   |   |\r\n|   | H |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | F |   |   |\r\n|   |*S*|   |   |   |   |   |   |   | O |   |   |\r\n|   |*T*|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |*R*|   |   |\r\n| . | A | Y | N |*O*| T |*O*| C | O | M | . | . |\r\n|   | . |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | . |   |   |\r\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | . |   |   |\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nReading this gives the answer:\r\n`LUNAR STONE ON RADICAL ROOTS`{.answer}.",
      "author_notes": "Since the puzzle hunt was named MOSP,\r\nI wanted the metapuzzle to be based around the letter S.\r\nI had the idea of using Steve's stones, from USAMO 2015,\r\nas the mechanic, since it was a reference that this group might appreciate.\r\n\r\nThe original form of the puzzle was a bit simpler.\r\nThe only given data was\r\n\r\n* A link to the Steve's stones problem in the flavortext\r\n* The blue numbers\r\n* The indices of the extracted letters along the S-path (out of 66).\r\n\r\nThe problem with this was that test-solvers kept trying\r\nto use the numbers 1-66 much too early.\r\n(There was also not enough confirmation that a crossword was the right thing to do,\r\nwhich we fixed by providing the across/down hint.)\r\nTo alleviate the other issue, we converted the\r\n\"look at USAMO 2015/4\" text into an additional Braille step,\r\ncarefully using Nutrimatic to create a cluephrase that would unambiguously\r\npoint to JMO 2015/6,\r\nwhile ensuring the pattern of highlighted letters in the giant S\r\nwould extract to the desired final answer.\r\nThis way people wouldn't try to reuse the green cells until towards the end,\r\nsince they start by getting an instruction out of it,\r\nthat pointed them towards a specific thing to think about.\r\n\r\nThe title of the puzzle used to be \"Escape from MOSP\",\r\nbut was revised several times to clue the mechanic.\r\n\"Sticks and Stones\" conveniently clues both the S and the olympiad problem.",
