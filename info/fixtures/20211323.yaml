    title: About
    content: "MOSP is the name of the puzzle hunt run at the [Math Olympiad Program](evanchen.cc/mop.html).\r\nIt
      was started by Evan Chen in 2021 because he had slightly\r\ntoo much time on
      his hands, as well as the assistance of\r\nSerena An, Sanjana Das, and Isabella
      Quan.\r\nAfter that, it was decided to make this a continuously running hunt\r\nwhich
      chronicled the adventures of the alternate-universe **MOSP**,\r\nwith new chapters
      being released at MOP each year.\r\n\r\nThe hunt is designed with longevity
      in mind: anyone should be\r\nin principle about to start with chapter 0 and
      enjoy\r\nnearly all of the entire experience.\r\n\r\nIf you're new to puzzle
      hunts, check out [this page](https://web.evanchen.cc/puzzlehunt.html#new). Otherwise,
      feel free to jump on in!"

    title: Rules
    content: "This guide is not part of any puzzle.\r\nIt’s just laying out some instructions
      for the hunt.\r\n\r\n## Rules and format\r\n\r\n1. \tEach puzzle has an answer
      which consists of English letters.\r\n\tThe answers are not case sensitive and
      spaces are disregarded,\r\n\tbut the spelling must match exactly.\r\n2. Each
      time you submit an answer, the answer checker will verify it.\r\n\t- This can
      take anywhere from 10 to 60 seconds depending on\r\n\t\thow fast your computer
      is.\r\n\t- If your answer is correct, you will be given a link to a new page.\r\n\t-
      Beyond having to wait a while to get an answer checked off,\r\n\t\tthere is
      no penalty or limit on checking answers.\r\n\t- Moreover, the answer checker
      provides extra nudges\r\n\t\tfor certain cluephrases that are close to the answer.\r\n\t-
      Therefore, you are encouraged to call in guesses as much as you want.\r\n3.
      The following ARE allowed.\r\n\t- Guessing as many things into the answer checker
      as you want.\r\n\t- Guessing at URL’s except for those under web.evanchen.cc.\r\n\t-
      Searching the Internet freely for resources.\r\n\t- Writing programs to help
      you work on a puzzle, as long as they are local.\r\n4. The following are NOT
      allowed.\r\n\t- You should not spoil the hunt outside the MOSP Discord.\r\n\t-
      You will NOT need to guess any URL’s on the site web.evanchen.cc.\r\n\t\tYou
      can try a few if you really want, but don’t bulk-guess for my server’s sake.\r\n\t-
      Do NOT make any form of repeated or automated requests to a server\r\n\t\tsuch
      as this site, Discord, Gradescope, Google Classroom, Zoom, etc.\r\n\t\t(For
      example, you should NOT write a script to randomly guess URL’s or answers.)\r\n\t-
      Don't try to hack the website.\r\n\t- **None of the puzzles require you to inspect
      the source code of pages.**\r\n\t\tYou can look if you want, but we think it’s
      more misleading than helpful.\r\n\r\n## Browser support\r\n\r\nThe only tested
      browsers are up-to-date versions\r\nof Firefox and Google Chrome (or Chromium).\r\nYou
      can try using other browsers if you want but you may encounter issues.\r\n\r\nYou
      should not use incognito or private mode,\r\nsince the website needs to store
      data about which puzzles you've solved,\r\nand it does so only on your device
      (the hunt website is server-less).\r\nThis also means if you switch browsers
      or devices\r\nyour progress will not carry over.\r\n\r\n## Courage and Patience\r\n\r\nThis
      hunt is quite difficult (not quite Mystery Hunt level but getting there),\r\nand
      we want you to have fun, so you should feel welcome to get hints\r\nwhenever
      you aren't having fun.\r\n\r\nThe hunt website will automatically let you redeem
      hints\r\nand unlocks as time passes and as you solve puzzles.\r\nFor each puzzle,
      hints will unlock after one hour.\r\nThe website keeps track of two currencies:\r\n\r\n-
      (\U0001F49C) **Courage**: +25 for every puzzle solved. Does not decrease.\r\n\t-
      Used only for unlocking new puzzles, and not hints.\r\n- (\U0001F49B) **Patience**:
      Can be exchanged for prewritten hints.\r\n\t- +30 for every puzzle solved\r\n\t-
      +20 each time a new puzzle is unlocked\r\n\t- If a puzzle has been open for
      t hours\r\n\t\tit gives ⌊3log⁡(1+t)⌋\r\n\t\tadditional patience (even after
      it is solved).\r\n\r\nThe choice of which hints were written\r\nfor each puzzle
      can potentially be a minor spoiler,\r\nfair warning.\r\nAlso, the hint system
      is implemented in client-side Javascript,\r\nso you can hack it if you really
      wanted to.\r\n\r\nFinally, feel free to ping `@admin` for additional hints too.\r\nNo
      charge for doing so.\r\nIf you choose to do so, it helps if you can link\r\nthe
      spreadsheet that you're working on:\r\nwe can give better advice if we can see
      your work.\r\n\r\n## Teams\r\n\r\nThere is no limit on team size but\r\nwe think
      that most people will have the most fun\r\nworking on the hunt **in teams of
      3-5 people**.\r\n(Which conveniently is equal to the number of people\r\nin
      your social group if you signed up for one.)"

    title: Saving Progress
    content: "When you first load the website, it generates a token for you once you
      enter your name. This is tracked by a simple cookie, so if you only access the
      website through one browser, then that is sufficient.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to
      store your progress across sessions, then you can do one of two things.\r\n\r\n1.
      After clicking your name in the top left, you'll land on a page with a long
      URL. If you load that URL on any other browser, your progress will be transferred.\r\n2.
      Alternatively, link your Discord account to log in with Discord.\r\n\r\nThe
      latter option has some extra perks: you'll be able to access the MOSP Discord.
      There is a dedicated channel for people who have completed each of the puzzles,
      which is nice."
